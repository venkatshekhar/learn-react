This code snippet demonstrates the basics of rendering a React element using the `React` and `ReactDOM` libraries without JSX. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### 1. `React.createElement`

```javascript
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!");
```

- **`React.createElement`**: This method creates a React element, which is an object representing a DOM node or a component. In this case, it's creating an `h1` element.

- **Parameters**:
  1. **Type**: The first argument `"h1"` specifies the type of element to create, which in this case is an HTML `<h1>` element.
  2. **Props**: The second argument `{}` is an object representing the props to pass to the element. In this case, it's an empty object `{}`, meaning no attributes or event handlers are provided.
  3. **Children**: The third argument `"Hello World from React!"` is the content or children of the element, which in this case is a string that will be displayed as the text inside the `<h1>` tag.

- **Result**: This creates a React element that looks like:

  ```javascript
  {
    type: "h1",
    props: {
      children: "Hello World from React!"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. `ReactDOM.createRoot`

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```

- **`ReactDOM.createRoot`**: This method is used to create a root DOM node where your React application will be rendered. Itâ€™s a part of the new Concurrent Mode in React, providing better performance and smoother rendering.

- **Parameter**:
  - `document.getElementById("root")`: This selects the DOM element with the ID `"root"`, which is where your React application will be inserted. Typically, this is a `<div id="root"></div>` in your `index.html` file.

- **Result**: This returns a root object with a `render` method that you can use to render your React elements.

### 3. `root.render`

```javascript
root.render(heading);
```

- **`root.render`**: This method renders the React element (`heading` in this case) into the specified root DOM node.

- **Parameter**:
  - `heading`: The React element created by `React.createElement` is passed here to be rendered.

### Putting It All Together:

- **Creating the Element**: `React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!")` creates an `<h1>` element with the text "Hello World from React!".

- **Getting the Root Node**: `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))` gets the root DOM node (typically a `div` with an ID of `"root"` in your HTML).

- **Rendering the Element**: `root.render(heading);` renders the created `<h1>` element inside the root DOM node, displaying "Hello World from React!" on the webpage.

### Result in the Browser:

When this code is executed, the result in the browser will be:

```html
<h1>Hello World from React!</h1>
```

This will be inside the element with the ID `"root"` in your HTML, making "Hello World from React!" appear on the webpage as an `h1` heading.
